# Political-Favoritism-in-Colombia
Data and code used in my master thesis "Political favoritism and social protection policies: Evidence from a cash transfer program".

The code used in this project is divided in two parts:
1. **Cleaning**: This script has all the data wrangling routine applied to the raw datasets received from the National Electoral Council of Colombia (CNE) and the panel data set received from UniAndes. As a result, I get all the datasets found inside the `/Data/Data - Processed/` directory.
2. **Estimations**: This script has the code used to get aall the Tables and Figures displayed in the main body and also in the appendix of the final vrsion of th document.
